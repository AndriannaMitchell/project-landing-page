# Dynamic Landing Page

## Quickstart/Demo

This project dynamically builds a landing page with a navigation bar that automatically populates based on the page’s content sections. As users scroll, the page highlights the active section in the viewport, and clicking a navigation link smoothly scrolls to the relevant section.

## Usage

1. **Navigation**: The navigation menu items will take you to each section smoothly when clicked.
2. **Section Activation**: As you scroll, the active section is highlighted, along with its corresponding link in the navigation bar.

Feel free to customize the content in `index.html` or add more sections; the JavaScript dynamically adapts to include any additional sections you add.
